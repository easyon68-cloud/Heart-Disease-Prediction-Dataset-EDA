Heart Disease Prediction Dataset Analysis

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 270 records and 14 features related to heart disease. It includes both numerical and categorical variables, with no missing values.

Features:
age: Age of the patient (numerical)
sex: Sex of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male) (categorical)
chest pain type: Type of chest pain experienced (1-4) (categorical)
resting blood pressure: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) (numerical)
serum cholestoral: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) (numerical)
fasting blood sugar: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = false, 1 = true) (categorical)
resting electrocardiographic results: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2) (categorical)
max heart rate: Maximum heart rate achieved (numerical)
exercise induced angina: Exercise induced angina (0 = no, 1 = yes) (categorical)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (numerical)
ST segment: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1-3) (categorical)
major vessels: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (categorical)
thal: Thallium stress test results (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect) (categorical)
heart disease: Presence of heart disease (1 = no disease, 2 = disease) (target variable) (categorical)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights:
Target Variable Distribution: The dataset is relatively balanced between patients with and without heart disease.
Age Distribution: Most patients are between 45 and 65 years old, indicating that risk increases with age.
Gender vs. Heart Disease: Males show a higher frequency of heart disease compared to females.
Cholesterol vs. Heart Disease: Cholesterol levels are generally higher in patients with heart disease.
Age vs. Heart Disease: The median age is higher among patients with heart disease.
